# Members-Only

Members-Only is an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

**In this project, I learned to:**

- authenticate users securely using [bcryptjs](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js/).
- Implement and show errors when something goes wrong. (e.g., passwords don't match when signing up)
- Create middleware to check if a user is authenticated.
